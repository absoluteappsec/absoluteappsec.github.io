        <p>Are you using WhatsApp, Signal, Discord, or Visual Studio Code, or Atom? Then you are using Electron.js even if you don't know about it. Electron is a JavaScript framework for creating desktop applications using JavaScript, which provides a lot of security controls out of the box in addition to the built-in security controls of the Chromium browser used for rendering the applications UI. However, every few months yet another Electron application reports a vulnerability that usually starts as XSS and leads to a remote code execution. In this talk we will look into what security controls are built into the Electron framework and how they are used or misused by developers. We will talk about how to shift left with security using frameworks, as well as with Visual Code plugins that will help Electron developers write more secure code.</p>

        <h5><b>19:00</b> // Adam Schaal // Automating Vulnerability Management</h5>
        <p>Did you know that an average of 14,600 vulnerabilities are disclosed each year? How are you handling your discovered vulnerabilities? Vulnerability management is a difficult task, especially at a large organization. In fact, it takes an average of 100 days until known security vulnerabilities are remediated. Often times vulnerability management is implemented in segments, without a big picture vision. It can be also arduous and cumbersome, costing employees valuable time and effort. However, vulnerability management is a necessity in today's cyber security landscape.<br>
        In this talk, we discuss where vulnerability management programs fall short and how we can avoid such pitfalls. We will walk through a typical program and the pain points. Once we understand the problem, we will enhance the process through automating asset inventory and daily vulnerability collection. We will also demonstrate how using automation to search asset inventory for newly discovered vulnerabilities increases speed and efficiency of the team and helps to more quickly create action items from discovered vulnerabilities. In addition, our process will help teams determine which vulnerabilities are the riskiest and organize them by remediation priority.<br>
        The vulnerability management program is built from the ground up across a complex work environment using Python3, Jenkins, SQL, and a few extra tips and tricks. Proof-of-concept code will be open sourced at the conclusion of the discussion and attendees will leave this talk with the ability to implement similar automated vulnerability management solutions in their environments.

        <p>Why does it seem that DevOps and Security are always at odds with each other? Why does Security have such a bad reputation among developers? In this talk, "Six Things DevOps Wants from InfoSec", you'll learn that developers actually WANT to work with Security - they care about writing secure code! But we as security professionals need to understand that developers don't want another "Big Brother" telling them what to do - they need an active and supportive partner in the delivery process. This talk will showcase six things that every DevOps teams want from their InfoSec teams. Everyone is on the same team, after all. Let's help DevOps accomplish their goal to release the best - and most secure - code possible.</p>

        <h5><b>17:30</b> // Jeff Williams // Getting Started with Security Observability</h5>
        <p>Software is incredibly hard to secure because it’s a black box. We’ve spent decades trying to verify properties of software by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc... only to be continually outpaced by software complexity. Instrumentation is a powerful approach for measuring security directly from within running code. In this this talk, you’ll learn how to use the free and open source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful runtime instrumentation without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. You can even create your own IAST tests and your own RASP defenses using JOT. Ultimately, we’ll show that security instrumentation empowers development and security to work together in harmony.</p>
