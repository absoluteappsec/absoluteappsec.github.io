        <p>Are you using WhatsApp, Signal, Discord, or Visual Studio Code, or Atom? Then you are using Electron.js even if you don't know about it. Electron is a JavaScript framework for creating desktop applications using JavaScript, which provides a lot of security controls out of the box in addition to the built-in security controls of the Chromium browser used for rendering the applications UI. However, every few months yet another Electron application reports a vulnerability that usually starts as XSS and leads to a remote code execution. In this talk we will look into what security controls are built into the Electron framework and how they are used or misused by developers. We will talk about how to shift left with security using frameworks, as well as with Visual Code plugins that will help Electron developers write more secure code.</p>
        <blockquote>Ksenia Peguero is a Sr. Research Engineer within Synopsys Software Integrity Group, where she leads a team of researchers and engineers working on static analysis and security of different technologies, frameworks, and languages, including JavaScript, Java, Python, and others. Before diving into research, Ksenia had a consulting career in a variety of software security practices such as penetration testing, threat modeling, code review, and static analysis tool design, customization, and deployment. During her decade in application security, she performed numerous engagements for clients in financial services, entertainment, telecommunications, and enterprise security industries. Throughout her journey, Ksenia has established and evolved secure coding guidance for many different firms, developed and delivered numerous software security trainings, and presented at conferences around the world, such as BSides Security, Nullcon, RSA, OWASP AppSec Global, TheWebConf, and LocoMocoSec. She has also served on review boards of OWASP AppSec USA, EU, and Global conferences.</blockquote>

        <h5><b>16:45</b> // Evan Sultanik // The Superabundant Benedictions of Programming an Absurd NES Game</h5>
        <p>One of my quarantine projects was completing the NES portion of my résumé. Among other things, that PDF is also a valid NES ROM containing a playable game. The game—which, to be honest, is only of minimal playable enjoyment—boasts a variety of fatuous Easter eggs and tricks. For example, it prints out the MD5 hash of the PDF. It also has a BF interpreter that steps through the execution of a quine. This talk explains how all of the tricks were achieved. We will also cover how everything was implemented on the NES’s puny 6502 processor with only 2kB of RAM, how its bytes were Tetris'd into 128kB of ROM, and how the file is also both a valid PDF and a valid ZIP. (Did I mention it’s also a ZIP? It’s also a ZIP.) Along the way, we’ll recite some parables, perform a devotional on the divinity of BASIC, meditate on what malware shellcode has to do with Brezhnev-era Soviet public architecture, and conclude with an allegory on how this all applies to a state-of-the-art LLVM taint analysis instrumentation framework. It turns out that forcing yourself to work in extremely constrained environments teaches you how to be a better hacker all around.</p>

        <p>We’re in the middle of a significant shift in how security teams operate and prioritize their limited budget and person-time.
	<br>Rather than investing in finding more bugs, many modern security teams are instead focusing on providing developers with frameworks and services with secure defaults (“guard rails”) so that developers can build features quickly and securely. When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks can enable organizations to solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole.
	<br>In this talk, we’ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:
	<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on</li>
			<li>How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes</li>
			<li>How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that’s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers</li>
			<li>How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company</li>

        <h5><b>19:00</b> // Adam Schaal // Automating Vulnerability Management</h5>
        <p>Did you know that an average of 14,600 vulnerabilities are disclosed each year? How are you handling your discovered vulnerabilities? Vulnerability management is a difficult task, especially at a large organization. In fact, it takes an average of 100 days until known security vulnerabilities are remediated. Often times vulnerability management is implemented in segments, without a big picture vision. It can be also arduous and cumbersome, costing employees valuable time and effort. However, vulnerability management is a necessity in today's cyber security landscape.<br>
        In this talk, we discuss where vulnerability management programs fall short and how we can avoid such pitfalls. We will walk through a typical program and the pain points. Once we understand the problem, we will enhance the process through automating asset inventory and daily vulnerability collection. We will also demonstrate how using automation to search asset inventory for newly discovered vulnerabilities increases speed and efficiency of the team and helps to more quickly create action items from discovered vulnerabilities. In addition, our process will help teams determine which vulnerabilities are the riskiest and organize them by remediation priority.<br>
        The vulnerability management program is built from the ground up across a complex work environment using Python3, Jenkins, SQL, and a few extra tips and tricks. Proof-of-concept code will be open sourced at the conclusion of the discussion and attendees will leave this talk with the ability to implement similar automated vulnerability management solutions in their environments.

        <p>Our personal and professional lives have become increasingly digital over the past few decades, with an epic upwards leap thanks to 2020 with so many more of us working, playing, and socializing from home. Also increased is companies' vested interest in keeping their (digital) assets secure, and their employees' and customers' data private. That interest is being "gently" encouraged by various certifications, audits, and regulations, which is evidenced in decreasing risk appetites. In this talk, we'll cover some of the most common security and privacy regs, and flavors of questionnaires that companies are now serving up in hopes to satiate their growing hunger for compliance.</p>
        <blockquote>Jennifer "Jen" Chermoshnyuk is a self-described connector of dots with both legal and tech experience but is neither a lawyer nor a pure tech geek.  An escapee from big law, Jen questioned and social-engineered her way into info sec and risk management. With nearly 20 years in legal, risk management, and information security - dabbling in privacy, Jen keeps her eyes on the horizon to spot emerging risks to help business navigate and face change head on.  She is a Senior Security and Trust Engineer for GitHub's Field Architecture team and lives in Seattle with her husband and two mostly-adorable daughters who are quickly surpassing their mother in both lock picking and developing devious social-engineering techniques: beware of children bearing strangers.</blockquote>

        <p>Software is incredibly hard to secure because it’s a black box. We’ve spent decades trying to verify properties of software by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc... only to be continually outpaced by software complexity. Instrumentation is a powerful approach for measuring security directly from within running code. In this this talk, you’ll learn how to use the free and open source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful runtime instrumentation without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. You can even create your own IAST tests and your own RASP defenses using JOT. Ultimately, we’ll show that security instrumentation empowers development and security to work together in harmony.</p>
